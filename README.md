# i2c-device-manager
A Python project for Linux-based microcontrollers (primarily Raspberry Pi) that allows remote management, control, and data streaming to and from i2c or other connected devices from a web browser.  Goal is to allow simple real-time configuration of connected sensors and I/O devices using simple editable interface classes behind a web socket layer.
